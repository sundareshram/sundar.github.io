Sundaresh has received academic awards, including the Technology Research and Initiative Fund (TRIF) Imaging Fellowship, and the Graduate Tuition and Research Scholarship at The University of Arizona. His research interests include signal/image/video processing, pattern recognition, machine learning, computational imaging, and inverse problems and applications of these methods in the biological sciences, conventional and medical imaging, and data science. He has developed solutions for multiple applications in advanced signal, image, and video processing, involving various data modalities, such as microscopy, CT, SPECT, MRI, and natural images and video. Research topics include sparsity-based image restoration, image reconstruction, graph theoritic image segmentation, non-rigid image registration, motion estimation, object classification, object detection and tracking, data regularization and optimization, and feature extraction.
