== Welcome to my homepage!

I am an Assistant Professor in the [https://med.emory.edu/departments/radiology/index.html Department of Radiology & Imaging Sciences], and the [https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/ Wallece H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering], with secondary appointments in the [https://med.emory.edu/departments/biomedical-informatics/index.html Department of Biomedical Informatics], and the [https://med.emory.edu/departments/medicine/index.html Department of Medicine] at [https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html Emory University] & [https://www.gatech.edu/ Georgia Institute of Technology], Atlanta, GA, USA. I am a member of the [https://aihealth.emory.edu/ Emory Empathetic AI for Health Institute] at Emory University.

== Research Interests

My research interests include:

- Signal, Image, and Video Processing
- Computaional Imaging
- Medical Imaging
- Inverse Problems
- Pattern Recognition & Machine Learning
- Image Analysis & Computer Vision
- Signal Detection & Estimation Theory


My research interests lie in the broad area of image science with applications to various imaging technologies. I am interested in developing new multidimensional signal processing methodologies/tools and applying these tools to a wide range of imaging applications in biology, medicine, consumer electronics, homeland security, and data science. My recent focus has been on problems involving mathematical modeling of machine learning, signal transformation & representations, and information processing.
#I work on inverse problems in imaging. Specifically, I have been working on topics at the intersection of signal, image & video processing, computer vision, pattern recognition and machine learning.
